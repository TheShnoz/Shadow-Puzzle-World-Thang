		SHADOW WORLD

README

	Shadow World is an isometric(2.5D) puzzle game where you explore the dark and empty world
	trying to find another creature like you. As you play you find new forms/genomes to transform 
	into to help you traverse the world and complete puzzles. 

	The ending of Shadow World depends on how many puzzles you complete with a certain form/genome
	to promote replayability.

	This game is supposed to provoke a loneliness and a drive to find a connection with another
	shadow creature. It is a synthesis of art and technology to make something truly sublime.
